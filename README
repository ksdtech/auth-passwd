auth-passwd

This is a mishmash project built on the Padrino Sinatra framework.

There are a couple of functions that it serves:

1. Provide a "forgot-password" system for a rather complicated set of
credentials for three related websites, each with different password
schemes.

2. Provide a session-cookie generating login/logout system that is 
meant to work with Apache 2.x mod_auth_cookie_mysql module.  A simplified
build of that project is also included.

For more information on mod_auth_cookie_mysql, see original author's
