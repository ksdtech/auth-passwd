                        MOD_AUTH_COOKIE_MYSQL2

Introduction
============

  This module is written for apache 2.0,2.2. If you are using apache 1.3
  please refer to the following website to get the appropriate module:

      http://home.digithi.de/digithi/dev/mod_auth_cookie_mysql/

  If you are using apache 2.x it is although a good idea to visit

      http://home.digithi.de/digithi/dev/mod_auth_cookie_mysql/

  where you can get further documentation, configuration samples,
  tips and help for this module.

  There are many ways to configure, compile and install this module.
  In this file the most common way is described, the installation as
  DSO (Dynamic shared Object).

REQUIREMENTS
============

  To compile this module you need

    * gcc, make
    * apache 2.x webserver and its development files
    * mysql database and its development files
  
  The following files are needed by the Makefile and should by in your PATH:

    * apxs
    * mysql_config

  Both files are needed to compile the module successfully.

  If one or both of the files are not in your environment path, either add it
  to your PATH environment variable

   export PATH=<path to apxs>:<path to mysql_config:${PATH}

  OR modify the Makefile by adding the absolute path to the "apxs" and
  "mysql_config" commands, i.e. change

    APXS = apxs

  to

    APXS = /usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs

  if apxs resists under /usr/local/apache2/bin.

INSTALLATION
============

  This documentation covers the installation as Dynamic shared object (DSO).
  Other types are possible but are not discussed here.

  The installation as DSO is quite simple. Type

    make
    make install

  This should compile the module and install it into the default modules directory
  of your apache installation. The apxs program knows all paths and information
  it needs to install the module. If the make process is complaining about missing
  header files etc, please check the required files/resources under the topic
  "REQUIREMENTS".

CONFIGURATION
=============
  
  The module has to be activated in your httpd.conf. This is normally done by
  apxs in the "make install" step. To be sure all went right, please look in your
  httpd.conf and verify that something like the following line is present.

    LoadModule auth_cookie_mysql2_module <somepath>/mod_auth_cookie_mysql2.so

  If it is not present, add it manually.
  Thats it, after a restart of the apache webserver the module should be loaded
  automatically.

  Now its time to look at the configuration samples at the following website:

      http://home.digithi.de/digithi/dev/mod_auth_cookie_mysql/

  There you can hopefully find the documentation of all configuration directives
  and configuration samples.
